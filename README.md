# CommissionCalc3
Java1 week4

This was my third individual assignment for JAVA PROGRAMMING I.

Here were the requirements for the assignment:

Modify the Week Three Java™ application using Java™ NetBeans™ IDE to meet these additional and changed business requirements:
The application will now compare the total annual compensation of at least two salespersons.
It will calculate the additional amount of sales that each salesperson must achieve to match or 
exceed the higher of the two earners.
The application should ask for the name of each salesperson being compared.
The Java™ application should also meet these technical requirements:
The application should have at least one class, in addition to the application’s controlling class.
The source code must demonstrate the use of Array or ArrayList.
There should be proper documentation in the source code.
